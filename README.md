# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## ♟️ Chess

I am working on a Chess application that you can run using Java. Because the code is written in Java it is cross-platform so you can run it on basically every operating system. If you want to run this in VSCode I have include a folder for that. There will be a JAR file available after it is playable.

## Progress Report

 - December 11, 2021 - created chess board and added pieces.
